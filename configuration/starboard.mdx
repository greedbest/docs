## Overview

The starboard is a community-driven highlighting system. When a message receives enough reactions (stars, or any emoji you choose), greed reposts it to a designated gallery channel.

## Getting Started

Create a new starboard by specifying the emoji to track and the channel where highlighted messages should be posted.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,starboard add (emoji) #channel
```

```javascript Example
,starboard add ⭐ #starboard
,starboard add :clown: #clownboard
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  greed supports multiple starboards per server! You can have one for stars, one for clowns, and even one for custom emojis.
</Tip>
