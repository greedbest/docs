## Configuring the antiraid system

Firstly, toggle on antiraid using the `,antiraid toggle on` command.

## Setting up antiraid modules

<Warning>
  Antiraid is **not** like [antinuke](/moderation/antinuke) and can be edited by **anyone** with the `administrator` permission.
</Warning>

Antiraid consists of several modules that monitor join events to prevent raids.

### Available Modules

- **massjoin**: Detects when a large number of members join in a short period.
- **avatar**: Detects members joining with the default Discord profile picture.
- **newaccounts**: Detects members joining with accounts created very recently.

### Module Configuration

You can configure each module using the following commands:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Toggle
,antiraid module (module) toggle (on/off)
```

```javascript Threshold
,antiraid module (module) threshold (value)
```

```javascript Punishment
,antiraid module (module) punishment (action)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Example: `,antiraid module massjoin threshold 10` will trigger if 10 people join within the detection window.
</Tip>

## Lockdown

If your server is under an active raid, you can use the lockdown command to quickly restrict access.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Command
,antiraid lockdown (on/off)
```

```javascript Example
,antiraid lockdown on
```
</CodeGroup>

## Logging

It is highly recommended to set a log channel for antiraid to monitor its actions.

```javascript
,antiraid logs (channel)
```

## Whitelisting

You can whitelist specific users or roles from being affected by the antiraid.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Add
,antiraid whitelist add (user/role)
```

```javascript Remove
,antiraid whitelist remove (user/role)
```
</CodeGroup>
