## Overview

Reaction roles are an easy way for users to pick up roles for notifications, colors, or access to different parts of your server.

## Setting up Reaction Roles

To set up a reaction role, you'll need the link to the message you want people to react to, the emoji they should react with, and the role they will receive.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,reactionrole add (message_link) (emoji) (role)
```

```javascript Example
,reactionrole add https://discord.com/channels/... :verified: @Member
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  The message link can be obtained by right-clicking a message and selecting **Copy Message Link**.

## Managing Reaction Roles

### Viewing existing roles
Use the list command to see all reaction roles currently active in your server.
```javascript
,reactionrole list
```

### Removing a reaction role
If you no longer want a specific reaction role, you can remove it using the same message link and emoji.
```javascript
,reactionrole remove (message_link) (emoji)
```

### Clearing all roles
To remove every reaction role from a message or the entire server, use the clear command.
```javascript
,reactionrole clear [message_link]
```

<Tip>
  greed will automatically attempt to add the reaction to the message when you create the reaction role. Make sure the bot has permission to react in that channel!
