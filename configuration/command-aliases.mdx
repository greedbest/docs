## Overview

Command aliases allow you to create custom "shortcuts" for greed's existing commands. This is useful for making commands easier to remember or for translating them into your own language.

## Creating an Alias

Map a new command name to an existing greed command.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,alias add (new_command) (original_command)
```

```javascript Example
,alias add kickout kick
,alias add vanish purge
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Once added, you can use `,kickout @user` just like you would use `,kick @user`.
</Tip>

## Management Commands

### Viewing Aliases
See all custom aliases currently configured in your server.
```javascript
,alias list
```

### Removing an Alias
Delete a specific alias.
```javascript
,alias remove (alias_name)
```

### Resetting Everything
Remove all custom aliases and return to greed's defaults.
```javascript
,alias removeall
```

<Warning>
  You cannot override greed's built-in commands with aliases. If a command already exists, you won't be able to use its name for an alias.
</Warning>
