## Overview

greed's logging system allows you to monitor server activity across various categories. You can direct different types of logs to specific channels, ensuring your staff stays informed without cluttering your main channels.

## Setting up Logs

To start logging, you need to add a channel to a specific log category.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Syntax
,logs add (channel) (module)
```


```javascript Example
,logs add messages #message-logs
,logs add moderation #mod-logs
```

</CodeGroup>

## Log Modules

greed can track a wide range of activities. You can assign different modules to different channels to keep things organized.

| Module         | Description                                                           |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `messages`     | Message edits and deletions.                                          |
| `members`      | Users joining, leaving, and profile updates (nickname, roles).        |
| `moderation`   | Bans, kicks, mutes, and other staff actions.                          |
| `server`       | Channel creation/deletion, role updates, and server setting changes.  |
| `voice`        | Users joining, leaving, or switching voice channels.                  |
| `channels`     | Detailed logs for channel creation, deletion, and permission updates. |
| `roles`        | Detailed logs for role creation, deletion, and permission updates.    |
| `invites`      | Tracking when invites are created, deleted, or used.                  |
| `emojis`       | Logs for emoji creation, deletion, and name changes.                  |
| `stickers`     | Logs for sticker creation, deletion, and name changes.                |
| `integrations` | Tracking changes to server integrations and webhooks.                 |
| `soundboard`   | Logs for soundboard sounds being added, removed, or updated.          |

## Management Commands

### Viewing configurations

Check which categories are being logged and where.

```javascript
,logs view
```

### Removing a log

Stop logging a specific category or remove a channel from the system.

```javascript
,logs remove [channel] [module]
```

Don't input a channel or module to remove all logging events.

<Tip>
  You can log multiple categories to the same channel! Simply run `,logs add` for each category you want to track there.
</Tip>

## Moderation Logs

For specific moderation actions (bans, kicks, mutes), you can use a dedicated setting to define the log channel. By default, this is the `#logs` channel that is created when you run `,setup` 

```javascript
,settings modlog #channel
```
