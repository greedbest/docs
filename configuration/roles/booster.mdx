## Getting Started

Personalized booster roles allow your server's boosters to create a custom role with their own name, color, and icon. This feature is a great way to reward your most loyal community members.

### Requirements
- **Boost Tier 2**: Your server must be at least Boost Tier 2 for this feature to be available.
- **Boosting**: The user must be actively boosting the server (or be the server owner).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the system">
    Run the `boosterrole setup` command to enable the system in your server.
    ```javascript
    ,boosterrole setup
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a base role (Optional)">
    Use the `boosterrole base` command to set a role that booster roles will be positioned under. This ensures boosters don't accidentally get permissions higher than intended.
    ```javascript
    ,boosterrole base @Member
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing your role

Once enabled, boosters can use the following commands to manage their custom role.

### Creating a role
Create your personalized role with a name and optional hex colors. greed supports up to 3 colors for gradient roles on servers with enhanced color support.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,boosterrole create (name) [color1] [color2] [color3]
```

```javascript Example
,boosterrole create greed-fan #BCBCE3
,boosterrole create "Super Booster" #ff0000 #00ff00 #0000ff
```
</CodeGroup>

### Customizing appearance
You can update your role's color, name, and icon at any time.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Changing the color">
    Update your role color with one or more hex codes.
    ```javascript
    ,boosterrole color #DEDEFF
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Renaming the role">
    Change the name of your personalized role.
    ```javascript
    ,boosterrole rename New Name
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Setting an icon">
    Set a custom icon for your role using an emoji or a direct image URL.
    ```javascript
    ,boosterrole icon :greed:
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Admin Commands

Administrators can manage the booster role system using these subcommands:

- `,boosterrole list`: View all personalized roles in the server.
- `,boosterrole sync`: Manually sync role permissions if needed.
- `,boosterrole delete [user]`: Delete your own booster role or a specific user's booster role.
- `,boosterrole disable`: Turn off the booster role system entirely.

<Tip>
  Use `,boosterrole filter` to manage a list of prohibited words for booster role names.
