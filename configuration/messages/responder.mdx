## Overview

Auto responders allow greed to automatically reply to messages that contain specific keywords. This is a powerful tool for automated FAQs, community jokes, or server moderation warnings.

## Creating a Response

To create a new responder, you'll need the trigger keyword and the response (text, embed, or script).

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,autoresponder add (trigger) (response) [flags]
```

```javascript Example
,autoresponder add !help Please check our #rules for more info! --reply
,autoresponder add "ping" pong! --strict
```
</CodeGroup>

## Trigger Logic & Flags

You can fine-tune how sensitive your responder is and how it delivers the response.

### Configuration Flags
Add these at the end of your command:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="--strict">
    The responder will **only** trigger if the message content exactly matches the trigger keyword, with no other text around it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="--reply">
    greed will use the Discord "Reply" feature (mentioning the user) when delivering the response.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Advanced Triggers
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multi-word triggers">
    If your trigger keyword contains spaces, wrap it in "quotes" (e.g., `"good morning"`).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dynamic Variables">
    Use [scripting variables](/resources/scripting/variables) like `{user}`, `{channel}`, or `{guild}` in your responses to make them feel personal.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
