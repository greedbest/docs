## Overview

greed features a robust, dual-track leveling system that rewards both text and voice activity. With real-time stats, dynamic rank cards, and automated role rewards, it's designed to keep your community engaged.

## Getting Started

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,levels setup
```
</CodeGroup>

Through the setup menu, you can:
- Toggle **Text** and **Voice** XP independently.
- Set a custom **Award Channel** for level-up announcements.
- Customize the **Award Message** with variables.
- Manage **Level Roles** directly through menus.

## Earning XP

Members earn XP passively by participating in the server.

### Text XP
- Earned by sending messages in text channels.
- Includes anti-spam protection to ensure fair leveling.
- **Commands**: `,levels live text` creates a self-updating leaderboard in the current channel.

### Voice XP
- Earned by staying in voice channels.
- Requires members to be unmuted and not alone in a channel to prevent farming.
- **Commands**: `,levels live voice` creates a self-updating leaderboard for voice activity.
