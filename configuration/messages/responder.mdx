## Overview

Auto responders allow greed to automatically reply to messages that contain specific keywords. This is perfect for FAQs, community memes, or helpful reminders.

## Creating an Auto Responder

To create a new responder, you'll need the trigger keyword and the response (text or embed).

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,autoresponder add (trigger) (response)
```

```javascript Example
,autoresponder add !help Please check our #rules for more info!
```
</CodeGroup>

### Advanced Triggers
- **Quotes**: If your trigger contains spaces, wrap it in "quotes".
- **Variables**: You can use [dynamic variables](/resources/scripting/variables) in your responses.

## Management Commands
