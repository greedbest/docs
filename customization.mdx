## Bot Customization

You can personalize how greed looks and behaves in your server using the `,customize` command. These changes are server-specific, meaning greed can have a unique profile for every community.

```

```javascript Avatar
,customize avatar (url or attachment)
```

```javascript Banner
,customize banner (url or attachment)
```

```
</CodeGroup>

### Profile Presets

Presets allow you to save and quickly switch between different bot profiles.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Create
,customize preset create (name)
```

```javascript Apply
,customize preset apply (id or name)
```

```javascript List
