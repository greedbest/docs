## Overview

greed's bump reminder helps your server stay at the top of DISBOARD by sending a reminder exactly 2 hours after a successful bump. It also tracks contributor stats to reward your most active members.

## Getting Started

Enable the reminder in the channel where the DISBOARD bot works.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,bumpreminder enable
```
</CodeGroup>

Once enabled, greed will watch for the DISBOARD bot's success message (`Bump done!`) and automatically start a 2-hour countdown.
