## Overview

greed allows you to manage Discord's default system messages, such as member join notifications and premium subscription (boost) announcements. You can set a specific channel for these messages and toggle them on or off.

## Configuring the System Channel

You can set the channel where Discord will send its native system messages.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,set system [channel]
```

```javascript Example
,set system #arrivals
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  Run the command without a channel to disable the system channel entirely.
</Tip>

## Toggling Notifications

You can choose which native Discord notifications are sent to the system channel.

### Join Notifications
Toggle the default "A new member has joined" messages.
```javascript
,set system welcome
```

### Boost Notifications
Toggle the default "Member has boosted the server" messages.
```javascript
,set system boost
```

<Info>
  These commands act as a toggle. Running them once will flip the current state (enabled/disabled).
</Info>

<Warning>
  These are Discord's **built-in** messages. For custom, fully configurable greed welcome/boost messages with embeds and images, please refer to the **Automation** guides.
