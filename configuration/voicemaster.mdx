## Overview

VoiceMaster allows members to create their own temporary voice channels by simply joining a designated "Join to Create" channel. Once created, the owner has full control over the channel's privacy and settings via an interactive interface.

## Getting Started

Set up VoiceMaster by creating the interface and the primary "Join to Create" channel.

```javascript
,voicemaster setup
```

Through the setup process, you will:

1. Create a category for temporary channels.
2. Link a "Join to Create" channel.
3. Post an interactive interface for easy management.

Every temporary channel owner can manage their VC using the buttons posted during setup or via commands.
