## Overview

Button roles are a modern, high-conversion way to handle self-assigning roles. Unlike reactions, buttons provide a clear call to action and support custom labels and styles.

## Creating Button Roles

To create a button role, you must first have an existing message (sent by anyone) that the buttons will be attached to.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,buttonrole add (message_link) (role) [style] [emoji] [label]
```

```javascript Example
,buttonrole add https://discord.com/... @Announcements blurple :bell: Notify Me
```
</CodeGroup>

## Customization Options

### Button Styles
You can customize the appearance of the button using these style names or colors:

| Style | Color |
| :--- | :--- |
| `primary` / `blurple` | Blurple (Discord Blue) |
| `secondary` / `grey` | Grey |
| `success` / `green` | Green |
| `danger` / `red` | Red |

### Label & Emoji
- **Label**: The text displayed on the button. If omitted, it defaults to the role's name.
- **Emoji**: You can use standard or custom emojis on the button.
