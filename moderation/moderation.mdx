## Setup mute roles

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup mute roles, jail, and logs.">
    Use the `,setup` command to setup mute roles, jail, and logs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check everything is completed.">
    Make sure you have the **greed-mod** category, with the `#logs` and `#jail` channels.

    <Info>
      Jail is similar to mute, but it restricts the user from viewing all channels except the jail channel. All moderation actions by greed will show up in the logs channel.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once completed, you will see some new roles aswell.

**imute** - Restricts the user from uploading images in any channel

**rmute** - Restricts the user from adding reactions or using external emoji.

**Jailed** - Restricts the user from all channels except the jail channel

- Renaming the jailed role can break jail, so it's recommend not to rename it.

> To reset / delete the moderation roles, simply do the `,setup reset` command.
