## Overview

Reaction triggers (also known as `autoreact`) allow greed to automatically add emojis to messages that match specific keywords. This is perfect for community memes, automated polling, or highlighting specific topics.

## Creating a Trigger

Add a new trigger by specifying the keyword and the emoji(s) you want greed to add.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,autoreact add (keyword) (emoji)
```

```javascript Example
,autoreact add "good morning" ☕ ☀️
,autoreact add greed 👍
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  **Multiple Emojis**: You can provide multiple emojis in a single trigger, and greed will add all of them.

## Behavior & Logic

### Word Matching
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Partial Matching">
    By default, greed will react if the keyword is found **anywhere** within the message content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exact Phrase (Quotes)">
    If your keyword contains spaces (e.g., "hello world"), you **must** wrap it in "quotes" for it to be recognized as a single trigger.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Restrictions
Whitelisting allows you to control where and for whom triggers are active.
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Channel Whitelisting">
    Limit autoreacts to specific channels. If no channels are added, they work globally.
    ```javascript
    ,autoreact channels add #channel
    ,autoreact channels remove #channel
    ,autoreact channels list
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Role Whitelisting">
    Only react to messages from members with specific roles.
    ```javascript
    ,autoreact roles add @Role
    ,autoreact roles remove @Role
    ,autoreact roles list
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
