## Overview

VoiceMaster allows members to create their own temporary voice channels by simply joining a designated "Join to Create" channel. Once created, the owner can manage their channel's name, limit, and visibility through commands or an interactive interface.

## Getting Started

Set up the VoiceMaster system in your server with a single command.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,voicemaster setup
```
</CodeGroup>

### What happens after setup?
greed will create a new category containing:
1. **Join to Create**: The trigger channel.
2. **#interface**: A channel containing an interactive embed with buttons for easy control.

<Tip>
  You can rename or move these channels at any time; greed will keep tracking them.
</Tip>

## Customizing Your Channel

When you are the owner of a temporary voice channel, you can use these commands (or the #interface buttons) to manage it.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Renaming">
    Change your channel's name.
    ```javascript
    ,voicemaster rename ethan's vc
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User limit">
    Set a cap on the number of members.
    ```javascript
    ,voicemaster limit 5
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Privacy & Visibility">
    - `,voicemaster lock`: Prevents new users from joining.
    - `,voicemaster ghost`: Hides the channel from the list.
    - `,voicemaster permit @user`: Allows someone to join your locked/ghosted channel.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ownership">
    - `,voicemaster claim`: Take ownership if the previous owner leaves.
    - `,voicemaster transfer @user`: Give ownership to another member.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Server-wide Configuration

Administrators can set default settings for all new voice channels.

- `,voicemaster default name {user}'s vc`: Change the default naming pattern.
- `,voicemaster default bitrate 96`: Set the default audio quality.
- `,voicemaster category Voice Channels`: Redirect new channels to a specific category.

<Info>
  Use `,voicemaster join role @Role` to automatically give a role to users when they join a voice channel. This is perfect for hiding the #interface channel unless a user is in a VC.
