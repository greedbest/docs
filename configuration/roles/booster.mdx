## Getting Started

Personalized booster roles allow your server's boosters to create a custom role with their own name, color, and icon. This feature is a great way to reward your most loyal community members.

### Requirements
- **Boost Tier 2**: Your server must be at least Boost Tier 2 for this feature to be available.
- **Boosting**: The user must be actively boosting the server (or be the server owner).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable the system">
    Run the `boosterrole setup` command to enable the system in your server.
    ```javascript
    ,boosterrole setup
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set a base role (Optional)">
    Use the `boosterrole base` command to set a role that booster roles will be positioned under. This ensures boosters don't accidentally get permissions higher than intended.
    ```javascript
    ,boosterrole base @Member
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing your role

Once enabled, boosters can use the following commands to manage their custom role.

### Creating a role
Create your personalized role with a name and optional hex colors. greed supports up to 3 colors for gradient roles on servers with enhanced color support.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,boosterrole create (name) [color1] [color2] [color3]
```

```javascript Example
,boosterrole create greed-fan #BCBCE3
,boosterrole create "Super Booster" #ff0000 #00ff00 #0000ff
```
</CodeGroup>

## Management Commands

### Role Customization
Once your role is created, you can fine-tune it with these commands:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Color & Gradients">
    Change your role's color. Support for single hex codes or dual-color gradients.
    ```javascript
    ,br color #ff0000
    ,br color #ff0000 #0000ff
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Renaming">

    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Custom Icons">

    ```
    <Tip>Run without an argument to reset the icon.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hoisting">
    Choose whether your role is displayed separately from other members in the sidebar.

    ```

</AccordionGroup>

## Administrative Commands

Commands for server staff to manage the booster role system globally.

### System Management
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Base Role & Syncing">
    Set a "base" role that all booster roles will be positioned below in the hierarchy.
    - Set base: `,br base @Role`
    - Sync positions: `,br sync` (Ensures all booster roles are correctly ordered below the base)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Filtering & Names">
    Prevent users from using specific words in their role names.
    ```javascript
    ,br filter add (word)
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Global Status">
    Check how many booster roles exist and who owns them.
    ```javascript
    ,br list
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  Use `,br setup` for the initial configuration. Remember that greed requires **Manage Roles** permissions to manage booster roles.
</Info>
- `,boosterrole delete [user]`: Delete your own booster role or a specific user's booster role.
- `,boosterrole disable`: Turn off the booster role system entirely.

<Tip>
  Use `,boosterrole filter` to manage a list of prohibited words for booster role names.
