## Overview

The starboard is a community-driven highlighting system. When a message receives enough reactions (stars, clowns, etc.), greed will repost it to a designated channel. This is perfect for preserving funny moments or important announcements.

## Getting Started

To create a starboard, you need to specify the channel, the emoji to watch for, and the number of reactions required.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
,starboard add (channel) (emoji) (threshold)
```

```javascript Example
,starboard add #starboard ⭐ 3
,starboard add #clownboard 🤡 5
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
  greed supports multiple starboards per server! You can have one for stars, one for clowns, and even one for custom emojis.
</Tip>

## Management Commands

### Viewing configurations
View all active starboards and their settings.
```javascript
,starboard list
```

### Removing a starboard
Delete a starboard by specifying its emoji.
```javascript
,starboard remove (emoji)
```

### Ignoring content
Prevent specific channels, roles, or users from appearing on the starboard.
```javascript
,starboard ignore #staff-chat
,starboard unignore @Developer
```

## Customizing the Embed

You can fine-tune how messages look when they are reposted to the starboard.
