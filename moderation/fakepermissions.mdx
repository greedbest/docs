## What are Fake Permissions?

Fake permissions allow you to grant "virtual" permissions to roles. This means members with these roles can use greed commands that typically require specific Discord permissions (like `manage_guild` or `kick_members`) without actually having those permissions on their Discord profile.

<Warning>
  Fake permissions only affect **greed's** command checks. They do not grant actual Discord permissions or affect other bots.
</Warning>

## Adding Fake Permissions

Grant specific permissions to a role using the `,fakepermissions add` command.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Command
,fakepermissions add (role) (permissions)
```

```javascript Example
,fakepermissions add @Moderators kick_members, ban_members
```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You can add multiple permissions at once by separating them with commas.
</Info>

## Removing Fake Permissions

To remove specific permissions from a role, use the `,fakepermissions remove` command.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Command
,fakepermissions remove (role) (permissions)
```

```javascript Example
,fakepermissions remove @Moderators ban_members
```
</CodeGroup>

## Managing Configurations

### Viewing all permissions
Use the `,fakepermissions list` command to view all roles and their assigned fake permissions in your server.

### Clearing a role
To remove all fake permissions from a specific role at once, use the clear subcommand.

```javascript
,fakepermissions clear (role)
```
