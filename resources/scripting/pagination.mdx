## Overview

Pagination allows you to condense large amounts of information into a single message with interactive "Next" and "Back" buttons. This is perfect for utility embeds, lists, or detailed server guides.

<Warning>Pagination is only supported for messages sent by greed that contain at least one embed.</Warning>

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to turn a simple embed into a paginated interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initialize the Embed">
    Select a message sent by the bot and register it as the primary page.
    ```javascript
    ,pagination set [message_id_or_link]
    ```
    This defines the "Page 1" of your interaction.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Additional Pages">
    Use the `add` subcommand to push new content to the end of the sequence.
    ```javascript
    ,pagination add [message_link] [embed_script]
    ```
    You can add up to 10 pages per message.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Modify or Correct">
    If you need to tweak the content of a specific page without resetting the whole system:
    ```javascript
    ,pagination update [message_link] [page_number] [new_script]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Finalize and Navigate">
    greed will automatically add reaction arrows (⬅️ ➡️) to the message. Users with appropriate permissions can now flip through your pages!
  </Step>
</Steps>
